In the project so far we have documented the machine and the operating system. However there is no step-by-step instruction for the student showing him the way he has to proceed for designing the operating system. This roadmap is intended to do the same.\\

The current machine supports both integer and string data type. However the registers can hold only integers. these have led to various problems while implementing the operating system. One such problem is the non availability of using predefined strings in kernel code. Converting the current machine to a pure \emph{String} machine will solve this problem.\\

The project was developed as a means for replacing NACHOS. To reach out to a wider audience it would be better to host this on a public domain which would be accessible to teachers and students.\\

Since the student is working directly on the machine and developing the operating system from scratch, it is advisable to have a more advanced debugging interface.\\

Finally the deployment of the finished tool in Operating system Lab.
