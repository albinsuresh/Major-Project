This project involves the design and implementation of an experimental operating system. 

An operating system is a software (programs and data) that runs on computers and manages the computer hardware and provides common 
services for efficient execution of various application softwares. The outcome of this project is a simulated hardware and 
the design of an operating system  that runs on top of this simulator.  The architecture which is used is an extension of SIM known as the {\ESIM} architecture.

The implementation of the simulator provides the students, in operating systems laboratory, with an interface to be used for learning the 
basic concepts of operating systems like process scheduling, memory management, file system organization, interrupt handling and page table 
concepts. The proposed design of the operating system provides the students a basic idea of how to create an operating system 
from scratch on this simulator using the interface provided.
